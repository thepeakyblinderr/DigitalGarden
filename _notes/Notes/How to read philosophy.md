# How to read philosophy

***
## Highlights
- what is familiar to professors and what should be obvious to students. Students do not know what professors know about reading philosophy and what professors know will not be obvious to students
- Another reason to explicitly show students how to read philosophy is that reading primary texts well is doing philosophy, not merely reading about philosophy
- Readers understand a text when they construct a meaning by combining the result of decoding letters and words with what they already know.
- We need background knowledge in reading for at least two reasons. First, background knowledge helps us make inferential links among the sentences that are written on the page. . . . Second, we need background information to construct and retain a text’s gist. Given how our long-term memory works, to understand and remember what we read we have to relate the new information to schemas already in long-term memory. When background knowledge isn’t active or available, we can remember very little of what we read.
- Simple mastery of information is an interactive prerequisite for the creation of rich understanding
- three facets of the process of successful reading are delineated: stage setting, understanding, and evaluation
	- The stage setting facet requires students to read the entire article quickly. 
	- The understanding facet requires students to re-read the entire article very carefully
- Learning theorists refer to self-assessment and self-reflection as metacognition
	- Metacognition is “the ability to think about thinking, to be consciously aware of oneself as a problem solver, and to monitor and control one’s mental processing.”11 In this section, metacognition is discussed in more detail
- Flagging the article actually helps
- re-reading complex material is important for developing an accurate understanding of the text
- Reading philosophy is an activity and, like any activity (e.g., playing volleyball), it takes practice to become good at it
- It is likely that you will find unfamiliar vocabulary, abstract ideas, complexly organized writing, and unsettling views. I mention this because it is normal to have certain reactions, such as confusion, outrage, and frustration, when first encountering philosophy
- Your aim is to develop, or become more confident in, your personal belief system, by building on what you already know about yourself and the world.
- Basic Good Reading Behaviors
	 • Take care of yourself (take breaks, sit where you won’t be distracted, give yourself enough time to read well, sit in an uncomfortable chair to avoid dozing off, etc.)
	• Interact with the material (talk to your friends and classmates about what you have read, use a dictionary and philosophical encyclopedia while reading, remember you are reading one person’s contribution to an ongoing debate, disagree with the author)
	• Keep reasonable expectations (you may not understand everything without some effort, you may need to ask for help or clarification). • Be able to state the author’s conclusion and the gist of the argument for that conclusion BEFORE you come to class.
	• Evaluate the gist of the author’s argument BEFORE class. • FLAG and TAKE NOTES.
- Reading for Information versus Reading for Enlightenment
	- You are familiar with reading for information: You pass your eyes over some words until some information about the world sticks in your head
	- When you read for enlightenment you use a text as an opportunity to reflect upon yourself and your beliefs. Part of the reason why reading for enlightenment is not easy is because self-evaluation often results in personal growth and sometimes when we grow, we experience growing pains.
- A Three-Part Reading Process
	- Facet One—Stage Setting
		- (1) Pre-Read:
			- For a very short time, examine the general features of the article. Look at the title, section headings, footnotes, bibliography, reading questions, and biography of the author. The goal of the pre-read is to get a basic idea of what the article is about
		- (2) Fast-Read:
			- Look up definitions of words you don’t know and write them in the margins. Warning: Don’t get bogged down while doing this. If it is too difficult to figure out which meaning of a term an author seems to have in mind, or if you have to read an entire encyclopedia entry to figure out the meaning, just move on. (If you read near a computer see On-line Dictionary: http://dictionary.reference.com/ and Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/.)
	- Facet Two—Understanding
		- Develop a sophisticated understanding of the text. You should be able to explain to a friend how the author defends her/his conclusion. Once you are able to coherently explain the article in your own words, you have truly internalized it—good job. When reading for understanding, remember to do the following: • Re-read the entire article VERY CAREFULLY. • Correct and add to your previous flagging. • Take lots of notes. In these notes, rephrase what the author says in your own words. Remember: You should practice the principle of charity when taking notes. Describe the author’s view in the most favorable way possible. If you have trouble taking notes, stop at the end of every section or paragraph (sometimes even every sentence) and mentally rephrase the meaning of the text in your own words.
		-  Draw diagrams or flow charts of the major moves in the article if doing so helps you.
	-  Facet Three—Evaluating
		- When evaluating, your main tool is the summary you made, but you will need to re-re-read certain passages. At this stage, you are entering the debate, rather than simply learning about it
- (1) Flagging
	- Self-Monitoring ???   What? I don’t get it. I must reread this passage carefully
	- =x?   This means what exactly?
	- it is a good idea to write out more fully what confused you. If you can articulate your confusion you are a good way down the road to figuring out what’s going on. During your reread for understanding make sure to spend as much time as necessary to fully grasp what is going on in the “???” section.
- Linear versus Dialogical Writing
	- Linear writing moves in a straightforward way from one idea to the next
	- Dialogical writing explicitly acknowledges and responds to criticism
- As you know, in some debates there are more than two sides and sometimes people on the same side have different reasons for believing what they believe
