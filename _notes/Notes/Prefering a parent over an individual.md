There are two individuals one has children and one doesn't have if both needs a kidney and there is only one who willl get it ?
**Argument** - More number of people are dependent on him than an with no children hence outcome will be more harmful
**Counter-Argument** - why must the cost of preventing that outcome be placed on the shoulders of those who do not have children?
Both had choice. one A chose to have children and one B chose not to have why B's choice is not preferred ? It's obvious if he is willing to let A have kidney it will be more beneficial but he does not do that he will be called *selfish*. 

How one's desire to live life is selfish ?

What if the case if A has 3 children and a wife and B is not married but his mother depending on him
