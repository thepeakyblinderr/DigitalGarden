 ways to summarize data with numbers and graphs

**Why are descriptive statistics important?**
In January 1986, the space shuttle Challenger broke apart shortly after liftoff. The accident was caused by a part that was not designed to fly at the unusually cold temperature of 29â—¦ F at launch.

Here are the launch-temperatures of the first 25 shuttle missions (in degrees F): 66,70,69,80,68,67,72,70,70,57,63,70,78,67,53,67,75,70,81,76,79,75,76,58,29

The two most important functions of descriptive statistics are:
- Communicate information 
- Support reasoning about data

When exploring data of large size, it becomes essential to use summaries.
