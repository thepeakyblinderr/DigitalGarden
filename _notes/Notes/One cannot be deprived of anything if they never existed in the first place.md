A person born in extreme poverty had to go through a lot of hardship but now that person is in very good position after struggling for years , He can now afford the luxurious life he always wanted. Most probably he will live his rest of life in that way but if he was never born he wouldn't have to go through a lot of pain although right now he is able to live his life in a much better way than he used to be it had been much more better if he wasn't born then what about the pleasurable life he is living now won't he be deprived og that if he was never born ?
