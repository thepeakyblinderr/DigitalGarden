### General Idea of writing
Find a topic first --->Then Search For Literature 
This is LInear approach 

> Notes are not record of our thinking but thinking tool itself
> \-Richard Feynman 

Re-reading DOESN'T help it just gives you false sense that _I understand this information_ but in reality you are just familiar with that particular text and _familiarity_ is not same as _competency_ 
***

### Thinking process
1. What is it about ?
2. What does it for ...... ?
3. How does it connect with ....?
4. __Swapping perspective__   : from the context of the source to the context of one though 
(Thinking is a diffused mode)
5. Does it contradict , compliment , Confirm or specify that I believed before ?

### NOTES

- Brain is bad at storing Factual data 
- [[Getting things done|GTD]]
- The main purpose of writing is to remember or capture an idea so that in future we can work on it without forgetting
- A good workflow system is necessary 
- __Writing is not a linear process Its a circular process__ [[Hermeneutic circle]]
- Minimize the resistance 
- Not necessary one needs a complex system to generate complex ideas
- After reading a material , __write it in your words__
- Write as if you are writing for someone else
- Ideas don't emerge by themselves , they need external source such as reading, discussion etc. 
- For mind to be flexible and creative ,to be able to dive into wider sprectum of ideas , one need equally flexible external environment and system

## QUOTES 
> Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception


> You can't force insights into topic rather insights come naturally
 
> We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words.


>As the only way to find out if something is worth reading is by reading it (even just bits of it)
