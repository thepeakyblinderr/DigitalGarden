- design of tension member 
	- net area
- design of compression member
	- very lengthy and less cross section area hence **slender** hence buckle before reaching its full capacity
	- shortening of member 
	- buckling failure
- design of flexural member
	- loading perpendicular to longitudinal axis known as tranverse axis
	- internal resisting force - shear and bending
- design of plate girder
	- own fabricated structure
- splices
	- joining of column
- column base plate
- design of gantry girder
	- base below cranes
- torsional member
	- subjected to twisting
