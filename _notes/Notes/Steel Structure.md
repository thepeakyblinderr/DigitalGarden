# Steel Structure



## Steel structure

-   consideration while designing steel structure
    -   strength - [[design of members ]]
    -   [[connection]] - more imp why ?
        -   becase if it fails all members connected at joint will fail whereas if member fails only single member failure can be rectified
    -   financial feasibilty
    -   durability (coating is required from [[corrosion]])
    -   stability and rigidity
    -   adaptable to future extension


-   what is steel structure ?
    -   orgainisation of horizontal , vertical steel members and to share load and eventually transfer it too ground

-   what is structural analysis ?
    
    -   finding out internal forces
    -   after analysis **design is done**
    -   knowledge of material is important

- supporting system
	- [[line structure]]
		- dia less than length 
		- cable example
	- surface structure
		- thickness is small but other two dimensions are more
		- slab , chimney, water tank
- tie member in truss - tension
- strut in truss - compression inclined member

- Why steel as structural member ?
	- because of high strength to weight ratio
		- they are smaller in size can be easily transported
	- ductile material 
		- depends on percentage of elongation if more than % 15
		- if less than %5 then brittle
		- if in between then intermediate ductile - manganese
	- modification is easy
	- highest scrap value (+)
	- properties do not change with time as in rcc there is shrinkage , creep
- **Disadvantage**
		- corrosion
		- good conductor of heat hence impact of thet can be experienced in other room
		- due to high temp , strength decreses
		- steel fails in fatigue (reversal of stresses)
			- microscopic cracks
		- low temp - becomes brittle 

- carbon equivalent 
	- whether its weldable or not
	- depends on alloys 
	- < 0.42 % without preheating
	- preheating
