# How to write a story  John Dufresne TEDxFIU

What you think shouldn't happen to you should happen to character 
put obstacles in his way

Let your imagination run wild , don't think about how it will end because at the end **every story is your failure**

Your central character should have to fight for something, he should have to overcome the resistance 

There is couple , you open the story with the child and then explore whether the marriage will survive now or not , one of them tries to blame other , if he would have done it differently or had listened to her this would not have happened *You are making reader wonder what happen* 
his wife has a tattoo 

we should know about every detail in room because it tells us about the people who live there. you should try to describe every little thing at the starting as every little details will give insight and shape the character for you and you can remove other details later

he had a ring 
	 what was the ring like?
	 where did he brought it from ?
	 tell more about shopkeeper if necessary 
	 what is the purpose ?

conversation with shopkeeper
shop - why do you want it ?
M - for my daughter
Shop - what is wrong with her ?
M - everything 

what does he mean by everything ? - tell about her , she was drug addict , when did she start, did it have impact on parents , how she died ?

in the room there is a littl piece of jewelry, one should wonder what role does it play ?

There is cooler in the room that tells you that its summer

When he blames it on her , observe what she is thinking ?
what will she do ?
and suddenly she smashes the teacup and cat blasts off in the kitchen
she runs out and screams and then neighbors peak out and then take car goes to her parents
but he loves her and wants her to come back and apologize because he can't liv without her
this means **now he got the reason to save the marriage**  and that is how you have **central character**  and now he has to struggle 

he goes to her sisters home but she refuses it but somehow she agrees to meet him at the restaurant 
he works with troubled kids and believes that kids getting addicted is parents fault and her own daughter has fallen prey to it so feels little guilty about it

he looks at his daughter's photo and regrets it that he couldn't do anything

he askes her to come to marriage counselling with him

He thinks whether he should visit her place or not , he thinks what if she is with someone , you wonder who that might be ?

Two possibilities
1. they both recover from the loss
2. they are shattered and incapable of recovering 

> Stories aren't written they are rewritten

once you have written the story , you have to rewrite now you have start, middle  and end now you can add something may be remove something ,**you can writ more about that tattoo of her** give the story behind it, other example is that he has gotten that ring on the same day as his daughter's birthday
