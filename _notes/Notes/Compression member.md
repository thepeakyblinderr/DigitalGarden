# what is compression member
subjected to two equal and opposite force

# what is ideal compression member
- e = 0
- perfectly straight (in reality column has initial curvature due to which there is ece=eccentricity)
- no imperfection

# what is strut
- inclined member
- subjected to lesser load as compared to column


# what is boom
- principal compression member in crane

# failure of compression member
## Crushing/yield
- deforms in direction of loading
- short column
## Elastic buckling
- moves perpendicular to loading
- long column 
	- force required lesser than yield strength
## Inelastic buckling
- combined failure

# What is effective length
- that length of compression member that undergoes buckling
- point of contraflexure
- length between two points of hinged end

Depends on
	- type of support
	- unsupported length
# Slenderness ratio

- it tells us about the chances of failure

# Euler's formula
## Assumptions
- material is homogenous and isotropic 
- load is non-eccentric
- no crookedness
- no residual stress

# Perry robertson
- it is best since it takes everything into consideration 
- manufacturing process , imperfection , buckling axis
- Design axial compressive strength depends on **Perry robertson**

- $P$ given load multiplied by 1.5 gives $P_d$
- $P_d$ / $f_{cd}$   = area required
- we can assume $f_{cd}$ till 135 N/$mm^2$ 
 
- from given area choose one steel section with $area1$
- check its buckling class
- kl/$r_{min}$ 
- interpolate  $f_{cd}$
- use this $f_{cd}$ and multiply it to $area1$ 
- and you get $P_d$
- $f_{cd}$ can be determined using
- graph 
- table 9 have values for slenderness ratio and yiled strength of material
- numerical equation
	- it has $\alpha$ which depends on buckling class

# which is safe type of lacing
## single lacing non-intersection
safe since in intersection if one bolt fails 2a length will buckle
