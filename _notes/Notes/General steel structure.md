## What is Purlin?
to support the slab/roof sheets

## How to solve problem of shear centre ?
angle section connected to channel so that load passes through shear centre

## upper yield and lower yield
upper yield - max load at which deformation starts, means dislocation or **slip mechanism**, because of which it slide down to lower yield point

grain boundaries start to slip

lower yield - to maintain the deformation 

## What is design?
choosing appropriate dimension, material and shape

## Working stress method
worst combination of load
plastic region is neglected,so not fully utilized
*stress based failure*
### Disadvantages 
load can exceed
poor workmanship
section are large in size due to FOS

## Plastic method
plastic region is considered, but strain hardening is neglected
Bi- linear graph
*Strain based failure*

## Limit state method
we set limit and we expect it to perform with reliability till it reaches that limit
it is statistical method
### Limit state of collapse
yielding
bending
buckling
### Limit state  of serviceability
Deflection
Vibration
corrosion
fire


## what is bearing?
transfer of stress
