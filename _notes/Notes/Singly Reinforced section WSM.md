# definition 
when steel is on tension side only

# How to find critical depth?
from stress diagram
# How to find actual depth?
- from centroid of area
- equate first moment of area about NA

# Modes of failure
## Balanced section
- both reach permissible stress simultaneously
## under- reinforced section
- preferred since we can see sign before actual failure
## over- reinforced section
- not safe because it fails suddenly

# what is moment of resistance?
- capacity of section

# how to find steel?
- by comparing C=T
