What percentage of voters approve of the way the U.S. President is handling his job?

This is difficult to determine exactly as there are more than 250 million people of voting age in the U.S. 

But itâ€™s not difficult to estimate this percentage quite well:

Sample 1,000 (say) voters at random. Then use the approval percentage among those voters as an estimate for the approval percentage of all voters.

**Population:** 
the entire group of subjects about which we want information all U.S. voters

**Parameter:** 
the quantity about the population we are interested in approval percentage among all U.S. voters

**Sample:** 
the part of the population from which we collect information the 1,000 voters selected at random

**Statistic (estimate):** 
the quantity we are interested in as measured in the sample approval percentage among the sampled voters

**Key point:** 
even a relatively small sample (100 or 1,000) will produce an estimate that is close to the parameter of a very large population of 250 million subjects. This is the reason why statistics is so powerful.
