# Reading MOC






- While reading literature don't try to **analyze or deconstruct** it , just imerge yourself in the book, after you have read enough make a little summary in 2-3 lines uptil you read so that even after some time you pick up the book you wil be able to recall everything 
- after reading it first time don't worry if you didint follow or understood much , read review and come back to that book after some time. Books are not meant to be fully understand in single read
- If you feel like you can learn the way book is structured and it inspired you then go back for second reading
- Read - think - write , if you can't write it in your own words then you don't understand.
- Reading is not a linear process
- In order to understand deeply , *write* after you are done watching a lecture or reading a paragraph of book
- Superficial reading - draw horizontal line to break book into different section. it is important it helps in bridging the gaps next time read that material again
- Restructure - engage - deeper understanding - check with your current beliefs and arguments
