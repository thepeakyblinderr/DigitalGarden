- DON'T try to take notes during lecture/reading ,listen and try to write afterwards becuase when you writing on yourself you will have to try to remember it leading to more comprehensive understanding
- Read - think - write
- even restructuring sentence might help in some cases because you are actively engaging , **the more you engage ,the more it imprint itself deep into your consciousness**
- you are not supposed to understand difficult books in one reading - first superficial reading is important so that you get overall idea of what this book is about , what was the objective of book in a very vague way but now when you re-read it , you will make connection much more better as you know if you are stuck at something you have little idea about where to look in book 
- reject the idea that *reading is linear*
