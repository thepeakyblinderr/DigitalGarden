It’s tempting to sample 1,000 voters in your hometown. This is a **sample of convenience**. This is not a good way to sample because the voters will be different from the population of U.S. voters. 

*This will introduce bias*, i.e. this sampling will favor a certain outcome. 

**selection bias:** a sample of convenience makes it more likely to sample certain subjects than others

**non-response bias:** parents are less likely to answer a survey request at 6 pm because they are busy with children and dinner

**voluntary response bias:** websites that post reviews of businesses are more likely to get responses from customers who had very bad or very good experiences

To avoid bias what to do ?

## Sampling design
- The best methods for sampling use chance in a planned way: a **simple random sample** selects subjects at random without replacement
	- Let the computer choose random phone number and call them to get review 

a **stratified random sample** divides the population into groups of similar subjects called ***strata*** (e.g. urban, suburban, and rural voters). Then one chooses a **simple random sample** in each stratum and combines these.

# Bias and chance error
- Since the sample is drawn at random, the estimate will be different from the parameter due to chance error. Drawing another sample will result in a different chance error

		estimate = parameter + bias + chance error

- Chance error is unavoidable 
- The chance error (sampling error) will get smaller as the sample size gets bigger. Moreover, we can compute how large the chance error will be.
- This is not the case for the bias (systematic error): Increasing the sample size just repeats the error on a larger scale, and typically we don’t know how large the bias is.
