# Why?
- people prefer to look at pictures rather than numbers
- which one to choose depends on Nature of data

# Pie chart
good to show percentages but not for number of any entity - ex :( No of Cars)
# Bar graph
- When the data are quantitative (i.e. numbers), then they should be put on a number line. 
- This is because the ordering and the distance between the numbers convey important information.

# Histogram
- blocks with different width

- So the percentage falling into a block can be figured without a vertical scale since the total area equals 100%.
- But it’s helpful to have a vertical scale (density scale). Its unit is ‘% per unit’, so in the above example the vertical unit is ‘% per year’.
	- It is %(vertical scale) because area of block is in %


- **Histogram gives two kind of Information**
1. **Density(crowding)**
	- Tells about how many subjects for one unit on horizontal scale
	- For example, the highest density is around age 19 as .04 = 4% of all subjects are age 19. In contrast, only about 0.7% of subjects fall into each one year range for ages 60–80
2. **Percentage (relative frequency)**
	- Area= height x width

# Boxplot ( box-and-whisker plot )
- represents five key numbers of data

- The boxplot conveys less information than a histogram, but it takes up less space and so is well suited to compare several datasets:

# Scatterplot
- The scatterplot is used to depict data that come as pairs.
- The scatterplot visualizes the relationship between the two variables.
	- Ex: If education increases salary goes up
