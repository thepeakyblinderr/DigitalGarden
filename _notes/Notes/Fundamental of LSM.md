takes into account ultimate strength and durability 
we set limit and we expect it to perform with reliability till it reaches that limit
it is statistical method

### Limit state of collapse
yielding
bending
buckling

### Limit state  of serviceability
Deflection
Vibration
corrosion
fire

- there is partial safety factor 
	- material
	- load
- lesser FOS for dead since it is constant and more for live load since it is dynamic

# what is characteristics load?
95% probability that load doesn't exceed this value

# why 0.002?

stress-strain curve of concrete is parabolic till 0.002
it tells where the yield point is ?

# ideal stress-strain curve for steel 

# Assumption
- plane section remain plane
- tensile strength of concrete is ignored
- max strain in concrete is 0.0035
- strain in tension steel at failure shall not be less than
