# The Metamorphosis

Summary - he hates his job. The only reason he is doing it because he has to pay off his parent's debt. He envy his colleagues since he is not able to live luxurious life like them. He fixes in his mind that he needs to get this out of hell as soon as possible

Gregor started to think of all the scenarios to get out of yhe situation , what will happen if i somehow catch the train and make it to office my boss will still lash out on me. Soon his parents started worrying especially his sister, he struggled to keep everything normal as his voice has changed a bit , so he was cautious about that they don't find About his condition

slowly slowly gregor was getting hold of his new body.

After a while his employer becomes angry and tells him that he might lose his job

chief became little suspicious after listening to gregors voice and on yhe other hand he ws becoming more conscious of his new body

Chief was terrified and left running and his father started to show gregor his wayh to room, he was afraid of gregor but somehow managed to make gregor to go into his room but in the process he was heavily injured and blood was gushing out of injuries

Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret
Metaphorical language

His sister stil didn't get used to his look

Although her parents thought her as little clumsy or irresponsible but probably after this event something changed in her as she was growing older and since gregor wasn't able to provide , she acted as if she has to carry the family and she was very close to his brother, so she was least afraid of him that might have been responsible for her courage

 he felt that y taking away all the furniture and other things from his room would make him forget what it was to be human since he already was forgetting a lot of things so he gae it try to keep certain things in room as it is to remind him of his previous human condition
