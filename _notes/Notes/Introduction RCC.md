# working stress method
- oldest method
- bases on **linear elastic theory**
	- hooke's law valid
- stress governing method
- modular ratio method
## Demerits
- we are unaware of the true strength of material so we dont about FOS because of that
- results in large compression which is ineconomical
## Assumption
- plane section remain plane hence strain diagram is linear
- tensile strength of concrete is ignored

# what is shrinkage ?
reduction in volume due to loss of moisture

# what is creep ?
continuous deformation under constant load

# what is beam?
member subjected to transverse load

# how to decide whether section is cracked and uncracked?
by comparing developed stress with permissible stress
