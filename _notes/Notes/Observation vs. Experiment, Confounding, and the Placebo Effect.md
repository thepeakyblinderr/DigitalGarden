# Observational Studies
- People who eat red meat have higher rates of certain cancers than people who don’t eat red meat.
- This means that there is an **association** between red meat consumption and cancer: there is a link between these two.
- But this does not mean that eating red meat causes cancer: people who don’t eat red meat are known to exercise more and drink less alcohol, and it could be the latter two issues that cause the difference in cancer rates.
- This is an **observational study**: It measures outcomes of interest and this can be used to establish association.
- But **association is not causation**, because there may be confounding factors such as exercise that are associated both with red meat consumption and cancer.
