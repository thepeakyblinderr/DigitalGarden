# Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
- Few problems with language 
	- what happens in our mind when we want to express ourself with language ?
	- what is the relation between thoughts and words ?
	- what relation must one fact (such as a sentence) have to another in order to be capable of being a symbol for that other?

In real life we use language in a very pretty vague manner

in order to understnd a sentence we must first should be aware of the meaning of components of sentence. It is very difficult to be very precise for ex. They called me. It means a group of people or a Third gender person, we can't deduce anything until we have further details
