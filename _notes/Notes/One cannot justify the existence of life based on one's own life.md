Antinatalism is a view rejected by majority so when one is confronted with this question it is very natural for them to reject it. Most people support the beliefs which are supported by majority for that reason they find no need to support their beliefs with some logic as their logic is 'MAJORITY'. Majority don't really have their beliefs examined whatever they speak is repetition of someone else's opinion.
