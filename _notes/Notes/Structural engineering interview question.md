Request to provide Hostel accommodation 

Sir ,

  

I have been shortlisted for the structural department for written test and interview falling on 6 to 8 may.Therefore it is my humble request to kindly provide hostel accommodation with one parent from 5th May to 8th May.

  

With regards

# Introduction chapter
- **What is structure?**
	- a stable system which undergoes deformation upon loading and comes back to original position knows as structure
		- Opposite definition for **Mechanism** 
	- combination of vertical and horizontal members
- **What is structural analysis **
	- structural analysis predicts the response
- **Objective of structural analysis**
	- find the support reaction and forces in members
- **Difference between pin and rigid joint**
	- members connected with one bolt - pin
	- members connected with more than one bolt or welded then - rigid
- **static equilibrium equation **
	- for balancing of the force
- **compatibility  condition**
	- balancing of displacement 

# Static indeteminancy
- **statically determinate structure**
	- no of equation = no of unknown
- **statically indeterminate structure**
	- no of equation < no of unknown
	- Ex - propped cantilever , fixed beam
- **What is truss ?**
	- pin connection
	- strictly straight members
	- load only act at joints
	- to eliminate bending
- **Why $D_{si}$ is zero for beams?**
	- once we know the reaction we can easily find the bending moment and rshear force at any section
- **Indeterminate structures are more economical than determinate structures**
- **Stability of structure**
	- if $D_s$ >=0 still it can be unstable
	- ![[Pasted image 20220430134747.png|300]]
		- it is stable since it is deflected due to W and will come back to original position
	- ![[Pasted image 20220430134907.png|400]]
		- it is unstable because of horizontal force it will move and will never come back to position
	- External 
		- for external stability , all forces should not be parallel
		- if **three reaction** are present and it becomes unstable - knows as *geometrically unstable* otherwise is is statically unstable
	- internal
		

# Truss
- while solving for ex $F_{AB}$ 
	- find reaction first
	- apply shortcut at A and B for zero members
	- Always better to resolve inclined members

# Types of truss

# ILD
- variation of particular force when load moves from one endto another
- helpful in bridges and conveyor
- ILD for statically determinate is always **Linear**
- 

**How to tell whether beam is fixed or simply supported**
	to tell whether a beam is simply supported or not just look at the top and bottom of connection , if there is space to move then it is **simply supported**

**Pinned supprt and fixed support difference**

# Basic methods o f structural analysis
- depends on unknowns, lesser the better


# Energy prinnciple
## What is shear wall
- it resist lateral force
- to resist gravity loads like walls and slab
- stiffness
- at edge of building
- in high rised builiding , as core wall to accommodate lift

# Assumption in superposition theorem 
# Non-tech
## 1. Tell us about yourself.
I belong to Patna,Bihar (city, State)

I have completed my B.Tech. from ABC institute with distinction (or any other achievement if any)

I have deep interest in the field of Structural Engineering (your branch or subject of interest) and wants to pursue masters in this field.

My hobbies are travelling and a learning structural engineering software (try to have one hobby related to your branch)


## Question 2. Why this course or why M.Tech. ?
After completing my B.Tech. I found my interests in the subjects like structural analysis, concrete structure and steel structure also my b.tech. project was in structural engineering so I want to enhance my knowledge in this awesome field.


## Question 3. Future Goal PhD or Job : Weather preparing for IES or any other job exam.
If that course have good placement history and you are joining for placement than you can say “I want to go into industry after M.Tech.” but if That course doesn’t have good placement than you can say “I want to go into PhD after my M.Tech. but before PhD I want to complete my masters (otherwise they may suggest you to do direct PhD)”
