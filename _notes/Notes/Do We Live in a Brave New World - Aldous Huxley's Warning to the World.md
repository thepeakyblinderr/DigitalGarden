- scientifically managed dystopian society where freedom is just an illusion
- Manipulation of [[Free Will]] by scientific methods and drugs
- [[Aldous Huxley]] predicted in his book that there will be so much advancement , that people will be conditioned from young age to be submissive and not question the authority  
- The changes will be subtle that nobody will even notice it and can imagine the extent of it
- This is achieved through [[Weaponisation of behavioral psychology ]]
- Nowadays we can observe everyone needs constant stimluation. which people get through mindlessly scrolling through tiktok, instagram , reels , youtube which is creating a passive and spiritually crippled masses who are so absorbed in their entertainment they barely care whats happening around them.
- The main goal of dystopian society is to reduce the rebels
- Repetition of information and repeated suggestions can eventually alter the thought and form new pattern
- When we are watching TV alpha wave are generated and we are in hypnotic state, Day dreaming state  or in other word  _Ready to be Programmed state_ where critical thinking is reduced. As we have observed generally we are watching we watch it to entertain us so we just try just look passively whats going on screen without giving it much of thought. Resulting in creating masses who are just repeating what they have been shown in their words

 - Any man who escapes from reality through the use of alcohol and drugs in longer a free agent - [[Joost Meerloo]] ,  [[Rape of the mind]] %%#quote%% 

- This can lead to the [[scientific caste system]]
