### My Understanding
- Readers love to find everything on their own so don't give  them much or don't spoon feed them it's like - *Rare is the person who will watch a sporting event after hearing the final score.*
- when you need to give some explanation for why did they react  that way or acted that way means you're *telling*


###### Show don't tell example 

- **I reached over to pick up the cup.**
	- I reached over and picked up the cup
- **She screamed in pain as the knife sliced her hand.**
	- The knife sliced through her hand and she screamed
- **He said angrily**
	- He yelled and slammed the door



###### How to find out
- “I hate you,” I said angrily.
- I hate you,” I yelled, kicking the door closed.

###### Misconception
- ONE MISCONCEPTION WITH show, don’t tell is that you must show all the time. If you’re telling, it’s bad writing, and showing is the only way to write good fiction. If you want to sell your novel, cut out every last bit of told prose from your book.
###### When telling happens
- when we are writing shorthand
- when we don't know the exact details and intend to add later

### Quotes 
> One trick to test if you’re showing or telling is to imagine yourself acting out whatever it is your characters are doing. If you can do what they do, you’re showing. If not, you’re telling.

> Explaining the story makes readers think you’re insulting their intelligence


> The deeper the point of view, the more you need to show.
