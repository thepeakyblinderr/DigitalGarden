- For summerizing data with one number, use the mean (=average) or the median.

- Mean and median are the same when the histogram is symmetric.
- When the histogram is skewed to the right, then the mean can be much larger than the median.
	- When right side is much longer than the left side it is called right skewed

# Mean vs median :
If the median sales price of 10 homes is $ 1 million, then we know that 5 homes sold for $ 1 million or more. If we are told that the average sale price is $ 1 million, then we can’t draw such a conclusion

# Percentile 
The 75th percentile is called 3rd quartile: $ 85,000 
The 50th percentile is the median: $ 50,000 
The 25th percentile is called 1st quartile.

# Five number summary
	- smallest number, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, largest number.
- The interquartile range = 3rd quartile − 1st quartile.
	- It measures how spread out the data are.

# Standard deviation
